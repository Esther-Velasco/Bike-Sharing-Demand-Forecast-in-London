# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Forecast-in-London City

This repository contains all working files related to the final project for my Data Analytics course at Ironhack. 

## Description

### Context

The mobility of goods and people is one of the essential elements of urban development, characterising urban space and how it functions. Over the past 50 years, personal transport has been dominated by private vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. They have given users a great degree of freedom by allowing them to reach virtually any location. However, their mass adoption in cities has also led to congestion (with its economic impact and related increase in commuting time), has negatively impacted the environment (air and noise pollution), human health, personal safety, and reduced liveability and social inclusion. As the worldAs the world population continues to concentrate in cities, the negative impacts associated with transporting people and goods are being exacerbated. 

Cities are now actively starting to address these issues by implementing a range of different strategies, such as bringing in congestion charges and parking fees to internalise the negative impacts of transport[1], improving and promoting the use of public transport (PT), encouraging non-motorised transport with dedicated pedestrian-bike paths, and restricting the access of certain vehicles to the city centre.

### Project Description

With bicycle usage data from the city of London´s sharing service, the goal of this project is to analyse the trends and seasonality, in order to draw a Machine Learning demand prediction model. In this project, vLinear Regression Modelling has been used to get the trend, and an ARIMA model helped create the predictions for the next 10 years. 

Since the data is from january 2015 to january 2017, to demonstrate the accuracy of predictions, a conection to the London City API was done to gather real time data.

## Authors and acknowledgment
This project could not have been possible without the support and motivation received from my teacher, Aleks Boski.
Also, a special mention to my colleague Agata Płucienik who helped me in the project design, as well as in understanding timeseries analysis. 
Paula Bendito, for encouraging me to go in the direction of Data Analytics.
To Ironhack, for the unforgettable 9 weeks of deep-dive into Data Analytics and for providing a very priviledged setting to learn with others.
