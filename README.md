# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Forecast-in-London City

This repository contains all working files related to the final project for my Data Analytics course at Ironhack. 

## Description

### Context

### Project

With bicycle usage data from the city of LondonÂ´s sharing service, the goal of this project is to analyse the trends and seasonality, in order to draw a Machine Learning demand prediction model. In this project, vLinear Regression Modelling has been used to get the trend, and an ARIMA model helped create the predictions for the next 10 years. 

Since the data is from january 2015 to january 2017, to demonstrate the accuracy of predictions, a conection to the London City API was done to gather real time data.
